    <h1>MY EXPERIENCE IN STERLING BANK TRAINING SCHOOL</h1>
        <h2>Tech Academy #ilearn 2.0 Day 1</h2>
        <p>So, on my first day in training school, I was super-excited: bonding with my old time friends, the thoughts of the free food that will be downloaded by my stomach,the beautiful hotel I was lodged into, and lots more....</p>

        <p>Little did I know that a lots meets the eye....Before I dive in, need I remind you that aside bonding, I made new friends...So Adewunmi lightened the day by introducing herself to us, giving a preamble of what to expect.'No shaking on my side shaa'...not until she mentioned debit alerts; if we make-up any excuses for missing the classes in the next 12 weeks...<em>"If I broke na my business"</em>... </p>
        <p>The Anchor of the training;Instinct Hub introduced themselves...By the way, these guys are good oo..for more information on their website, please visit the link below</p>

        <p>We started with Internet of things which are web enabled devices that is able to receive data, transmit through a gateway and provide actions by giving a response. This can be a smoke detector which senses smoke, passes through a gateway and performs action through text-messages or mail received by the user. We also looked at blockchain technology and I understood that it is same with a web base, only that it can't be altered or deleted, but can be traced such as cryptocurrency, and lastly, Cybersecurity that involves protection of your information or anything internet enabled.</p>
        <em>I was overly excited..see excitement..very simple..can't wait for tomorrow experience!</em>
     <h3>Day 2 - Introduction to HTML and GIT</h3>
    <p>As usual, the day appeared to be exciting. We booked a cab using uber, was punctual(winks), seated for the day...then it started! languages! more or less, I would say speaking in tongues kind of thing:<em>this time around, writing in tongues...</em> I was like <em>'what the heck'!</em> This people cannot spend money in peace!But I had to pay attention. Sincerely, before I applied for the training, I have always wanted to redeploy from the branch to Technology department or any related department(I look out for adverts and apply, to the extent that the some of our HR employers are familiar with my name) and even went as far as enrolling on a private training as a Businees Analyst at JK Micheals, engaged in a mandatory project, even caused the problem and tried using my knowledge to solve the problem. Please don't get it twisted, I needed a platform to enforce my skills and so when I saw Ilearn, I immediately applied, passed the pre-assessment, and came to Lagos. So trust me when I say needed this!</p>
        <p>Back to my Day 2, Mr Noah of Instinct Hub started performing magic and I decided to learn how to perform magic too, and started understanding its principles like the tags such as h, p, a;heading,paragraph and link tags concurrently, style tags that comes mainly with css,how to add a background color to your coding, getting familiar with visual code, and finally gig aspect, where you push your project to be seen no matter the modification by someone. Oh...I was super-excited because I was already becoming a magician....After breakfast and lunch with all the series of repeated questions (I pity for Mr Noah), I went from:</p>
        <p>This<br><img src="img.html/ify.jpg" alt="happy" width="200">
        to<br><img src="img.html/la.jpg" alt="tired" width="200"></p>
        <em>Please lemme go and sleep tomorrow before I faint...ok bye for now!</em>
    <h4>Day 3&4-Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <img src="img.html/nk1.jpg" alt="okay" width="200"><p>'Thank God we dont look like what we go through'...Today was better than my previous;I mean,I know the basics of the magic and I am ready to be a magician...</p>
    <p>We dived into CSS which had lots of attributes and tags, but like I said, I needed this. So, I gave my utmost attention and began practising just like I am doing now(winks).Nothing spectacular about today though, aside learning CSS...By the way, CSS means Cascading Style Sheet and is used to design your web page however you want, just as you are seeing mine.
        I also realised the use of different selectors and declarations, and most times, new ones come into use when you engage in projects.</p>
        <p>There are several ways to style your page or website and it can be inline:in-between your codings,internal:as your header,or external:when you link your html project with your css page.
        <!-- in this write-up, i combined two types of styles as i am trying to see how it looks like...i won learn how to practise shaa... -->Sincerely, the day was going tougher and most of us that came with fully charged battery was already going low...Mr Noah noticed this on time and immediately charged our battery and it seems some battery was having issues(if you no what I mean)...Anyways, We were assigned a project and guess what I was suppose to do...Build a photo gallery!(as if the witches from my village will not let me be;<em>my initial thought)</em>
        Anxious to see what my gallery looks like?
        <em>"Chillax", you will tomorrow!</em>
    </p>
    <h4>Day 5- Introduction to Javascript </h4>
    <p>
        I am super-excited today because I got to create something meaningful(the thought of knowing the codes written behind the scene for something to come alive gives me sweet chills in my body).
        To see the magic/photo gallery I created, check out the link below:
